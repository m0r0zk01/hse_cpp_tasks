Ivan studied on my C++ course. During the classes he was very active, always participated in discussions and showed a lot of interest to the subject. He seems to be very  purposeful and intelligent student and he is eager to learn new things. I believe that internship is the best opportunity for him to improve his skills and dive deeper into programming
